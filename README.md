# BGLocation
iOS App to trigger location updates in background

It's an app right now but I am working on to convert it into a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin.

## As of now its pretty rough, but this is what I am focusing on:
* Consistent GPS Detection
* Distance/Time based filter
* Server updates (with Header & Parameters)
* Error/Log visibility
* Consistent Battery Performance 
* Swift based :)
